      <p class="lead">If we want to examine the preception of multiculturalism from the regional level, it is essential to view the bahaviors of certain fan groups who hold hostile attitude towards player, other fans, and public. Here I intend to approch to the preception through the lense of hooliganism. In October 1982, a 16-year-old Hamburg football fan was killed by a stone thrown by Bremen fans. Three years later, 39 people lost their lives, and 600 people were injured in a confrontation between Juventus and Liverpool in England. Tragedies such as these led to the formation of special police forces in all Bundesliga cities (the German soccer league) with task of separating the violent fans from others. However, the suppression of the physical clashes inside the stadium led to the increase of organized violence against foreigners and other bystanders outside of the stadium. The authorities tried to reinforce the control of fan groups to avoid injuries and deaths. This behavior set the hooligans on the opposite of the authorities which triggered hooligans to form and strengthen their organizations.</p>

      <p>
        There are various types of fans in German football culture. Since the subgroups inside the fan population overlap with each other, hooligans and ultras are often mentioned together in the mass media. Those who support their football club in an ultra-fanatical way are categorized as the ultras. Chanting, singing, using flares, drums, and banners, and occasionally violent conflicts with rival supporters are the typical ways for them to show support of their clubs (Perasović and Mustapić 961). As the largest young subculture group in Germany, the ultras get the most attention from the mass media. They often leave the public the impression of crazy football fans who are notorious troublemakers. The public tend to think hooliganism is one of the essential characteristics of the ultras. However, as Jonas Gabler who studies fan culture pointed out, “Hooligans take sports as a platform to conduct violence and they are not interested in sport itself. Ultra-fans are opposite of that (Gabler 2000).”
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most distinctive characteristics of hooligans is that they derive utility from fighting (Leeson et al.). Being able to pick a fight with other people is the main reason they go to football games. For hooligans, fights surrounding football rivalries are a central part of the sport,
or even a sport itself (Leeson et al.). In 2017, Deutsche Welle published a short documentary named <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqFDdFfwxU">“Hooligans in Frankfurt: Fans or fighters? (off!, DW Kick, 2017)”</a> Reporter Kres Harrington asked a few hooligans and tried to find out why they go into battle. Harrington asked, “do you love to fight for your team or do you simply just love to fight?” He received answers such as “this is… uh… kind of for myself and for the team”, “Ich kämpfe um zu kämpfen. (I fight in order to fight.) (05:38)” These answers further prove at least some hooligans enjoy fighting and believe fighting is a source of utility.

<p>
  In addition, the <a href="https://polizei.nrw/artikel/zentrale-informationsstelle-sporteinsaetze">Zentrale Informationsstelle Sporteinsätze </a> (ZIS) in Germany creates three categories in order to separate different fan groups based on their behaviors: category A, the “friedliche fan”; category B, the “gewaltbereite/-geneigte fan”; category C, the “gewaltsuchende” fan. As ZIS explains, most ultra-groups are considered part of the category A (“Ultragruppierungen mit choreographischen Inszenierungen fallen in der Regel in die Kategorie A.”). And the hooligans are categorized to B and C. In the ZIS annual reports from football season 2010/2011 to 2017/2018, the number of violent scenes conducted by categories B & C fans under the impact of right-wing ideologies is at least two times higher than the scenes under left-wing ideologies. The number of the hooligans who conducted violent scenes under the right-wing ideologies is also at least two times higher than the supporter of the other side. There is an obvious rise around 2014/2015 season, from at lowest 245 people to 410 people. (See chart 1) After two years of constantly declining, the number went back up to 385 in the past season. The data from the ZIS proves that there are people within the hooligan groups particularly prefer to conduct violent crimes under the right-wing ideologies.

</p>
<p>
  In the annual ZIS report, the Landesamt für Zentrale Polizeiliche Dienste (LZPD) carefully described the scenes as “politisch rechtsmotiviert.” Since January 1st 2001, the term
“politisch rechtsmotiviert” was defined as “wenn Bezüge zu völkischem Nationalismus, Rassismus, Sozialdarwinismus oder Nationalsozialismus ganz oder teilweise ursächlich für die Tatbegehung waren (Feustel 147).” Ideologies such as “völkischer Nationalismus”, “Rassismus”, “Nationalsozialismus” all belong to the far-right ideologies, which again proves that far-right ideologies are preferred by the hooligans.
</p>
<p>
  However, far-right (extreme right, populist radical right or radical right) ideologies do not simply equal the sum of those three components. Scholars hold different opinions on how to name and define far-right ideology. Often ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’ are used interchangeably, even though there are clear conceptual differences which must be recognized (Mieriņa and Koroļeva 185). On the one hand, some of the scholars tend to give simple definitions. For example, Macridis defined right-wing extremism as a political ideology that is the combination of the following various features: racism, xenophobia, and nationalism. Backes and Jesse positioned the extreme “right” of the “left-right spectra.” On the other hand, scholars like Falter and Schumann prefer combining more than ten features as the core of right-extremist thinking, such as “ethnocentrism, anti-pluralism, militarism, extreme nationalism, etc. (Mudde 2000 10).”
</p>
<p>
  After listing all fifty-eight features that have been mentioned in twenty-six definitions, Mudde found out the five features that are mentioned by at least half of the authors: nationalism, racism, xenophobia, anti-democracy and the strong state (Mudde 1995 206). In 2000, he improved the definition by providing one more character: internal homogenization to nationalism, keeping xenophobia, using law and order to replace strong state, adding welfare chauvinism. Seven years later, in order to present the internal hierarchy of the ideological feature, he concluded three core ideological features: nativism, authoritarianism, and populism, of which nativism is considered as the key feature.
